==============
Peter Nguyen, 2nd year Masters of Information Management Systems student with a focus on Information Systems Management, User Interaction, User Experience and User Interface Design. I am working on Brian Carver's <a href='http://www.courtlistener.com'>Free Law Project / Court Listener</a>, which interests me because I closely follow Cyberlaw and IP Law cases whenever they are featured in the news. It is probably one of the biggest areas of contention for the foreseeable future because companies have digitized so much of their operations (and assets). CourtListener is a major resource for lawyers, students, professors, and every day users-- so I feel like I can help a lot of people with my involvement in this project.
